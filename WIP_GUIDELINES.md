# Work-In-Progress (WIP) Guidelines

## Policy
- Default WIP limit: **2** active `in_progress` tasks per contributor/AI agent.
- Focus on finishing work before starting additional tasks.

## Exception Process
To exceed the limit:
1. Document rationale and expected duration.
2. Obtain approval from project owner or delegate.
3. Record exception in `WIP_GUIDELINES.md` reference and `BITACORA.md` entry.

## Operational Practices
- Prioritize unblocking blocked tasks before starting new planned work.
- Re-evaluate WIP during daily status updates.
- Use `PLAN.md` and project YAML as the source of truth.
